ArcIBM:
The Arctic copepod Individual-Based Model (ArcIBM) is a modified version of a generic Lagrangian tracking and zooplankton life-stage-based biological model [Ji et al., 2012]. The basic functionality of this model is to evolve copepods both physically (i.e., advection) and biologically (i.e., aging, maturation, and life stage development).
