Versions:

1.x.x - build one 'group of particles' type flexible enough for basic user needs by allowing users to add, initialize, and manipulate additional state variables as well as target state variables for netcdf export. 

  - possible sequence (geoff)
  1.0.0 - get something working in 0-d, single group only for Jess to start generic copepod model
  1.1.0 - add netcdf forcing
  1.2.0 - add a random number generator (uniform,gaussian,etc.) toolbox
  1.3.0 - add advection/diffusion 
  1.4.0 - move to D. Stuebe's netcdf and possible time module
  1.5.0 - improve lateral boundary conditions (reflection off solid, export through open)
  1.6.0 - parallelize particle loops, random number generator + hide i/o 

2.x.x - build an abstract group of particles class and deferred procedures and allow users to build new classes using extensible types - this will require full implementation of f03, not likely to be in gfortran until 2009ish.  - Geoff
